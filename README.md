<h3>Introduction</h3>
The goal of this "VM" project is to build a language system complete
with virtual machines, compilers, assemblers and translators
(GAP to C etc).

The system is being constructed in small steps, gradually and
incrementally for the purpose of accessibility. The material
could also be useful in a CS introductory
lecture on language systems. The chapters are as follows:

* C1: abstract syntax for SLP (Straight Line Programs [APPL1998], pg 7 - 12);
  compiler/emitter of VM code; and Virtual Machine for SLPs (C++, SML-NJ, Scala)
* C2: add emitter for assembly language to compiler;
  add simple assembler (Antlr, Java, Scala)
* C3: lexers/parsers for SLP (Antlr, ml-lex, ml-yacc)
* C4: replace SLP w/ GAP language (Groups, Algorithms, and Programming [GAP2021]),
  implement 'if' and 'while' statements
* C5: add 'for' and 'repeat' statements; move eval and pretty print code from
  `compiler` file into separate files.
* [C6](#C6): add string type to compiler, add string pool, string constants, string printing to VM/Asm

<h4>Folder Structure</h4>

Each chapter folder is structured in the same way:

* vm: the actual virtual machine (C++)
* asm: the assembler (Scala, Antlr)
* comp: the compiler for SLP (C1-C3), and GAP; the 'scala'
  sub-directory holds the scala version of the compiler, 'sml'
  holds the SML-NJ version
* test: test programs

<h3>Building the System</h3>

Given our goal of accessibility, we have attempted to make building
and experimenting with the system as simple as possible. As
such we have refrained from using build systems with involved
folder structures, rules, learning curves, and have instead opted
to place all required files in a single folder together with a
simple ant build file. Even Ant is not required, as it is
simple enough to build the various (sub)systems by hand.

<b>Building with Ant</b>

Define the `SCALA_HOME`, `ANTLR_HOME` and `ANTLR_CLASSPATH` environment variables, e.g.:

        export SCALA_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/scala/2.13.5/libexec/"
        export ANTLR_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/antlr/4.9.2/"
        export ANTLR_CLASSPATH="$ANTLR_HOME/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar"
        
        export PATH="$ANTLR_HOME/bin:$PATH"
        export CLASSPATH="$ANTLR_CLASSPATH:$CLASSPATH"

For each subsystem:

* cd to sub-system folder (`vm`, `asm`, `comp/scala`)
* run `ant`:

Task | Command
------------ | -------------
to build the system | `ant`
to build and test   | `ant test`
to cleanup          | `ant clean`

* if everything went OK, there will be`vm`, `vm-asm` and `vm-comp` binaries in
  the `bin` folder. To test/run:
  
      cd test
      ../bin/vm-asm asmtest.asm asmtest.vm
      ../bin/vm asmtest.vm
      
      ../bin/vm-comp test4.gap test4.vm
      ../bin/vm test4.vm


For the `sml` build:

    cd comp/sml
    sml sources.cm
    Test.run();

<h3>C6</h3>

Quick notes on the functionality added in this section: until
now, printing was restricted to lists of integers:

    a := 1;
    b := 2;
    Print(a, b);

would print

    1, 2

We've now added support for string arguments to `Print`, so now we're
able to format our output:

    Print("a = ", a, "b = ", b, "\n");

will output

    a = 1, b = 2

At the VM level, we added an instruction for string printing, `SPRINT`, and
a string pool to the VM file with the following structure:

      +-------+----- -+-------+-------+- - - -+-------+-------+- - - -+
      | string| total | str 1 | str 1 |       | str n | str n |       |
      | count | size  | len   | char 1|       | len   | char 1|       |
      +-------+- -----+-------+-------+- - - -+-------+-------+- - - -+

The assembler and compiler have to maintain a map of all encountered strings
to avoid the inclusion of duplicates in the VM file and emit the stringpool
as part of the VM file (`stringpool.sml`).

The only real complication is the fact that GAP is a language w/o type
declarations, which means that appart from having to add support for types
to the compiler (`type.sml`)

    datatype ty = ANY
                | ANYVAL
                | BOOL
                | INT
                | ANYREF
                | STRING
                | ARRAY of ty
                | RECORD of (Symbol.symbol * ty) list
                | NULL
                | NOTHING
                | META of ty ref

we also had to implement a basic type inferencing algorithm (`inferTypes` in `compiler.sml`).

The other notable change was the replacement of the simple/simplisitic way
of handling environments with support for symbols and functional symbol
tables (see [APPL1998], pg 107 - 111) (`symbol.sml`).

<h3>Notes on Migrating from SML to Scala</h3>

The file `Sml-to-Scala.md` in the dist root folder contains instructions on how to
convert _SML_ code to _Scala_. Understand that this is the way we've handled the
migration, and there are probably other/better ways to do it.
